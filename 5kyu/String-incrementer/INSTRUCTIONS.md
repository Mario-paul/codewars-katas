# String incrementer

Your job is to write a function which increments a string, to create a new string.

* If the string already ends with a number, the number should be incremented by 1.
* If the string does not end with a number. the number 1 should be appended to the new string.

Examples:

```zsh
foo -> foo1
```

```zsh
foobar23 -> foobar24
```

```zsh
foo0042 -> foo0043
```

```zsh
foo9 -> foo10
```

```zsh
foo099 -> foo100
```

*Attention: If the number has leading zeros the amount of digits should be considered.*
