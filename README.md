# Codewars Katas

This is my personal repo for past Codewars katas. It also serves as a testing environment for new katas using my own custom-made unit testing library.

## .js Files

### development.js

This file is the working / testing environment for katas. It's where you play around with code to find a solution, just like the IDE on Codewars. It's generally full of console.logs() useful for debugging.

### explain.js

Place a clean copy here and comment out explaining what the code does. Useful for future reference.

### clean.js

Clean your code of console.logs(), comments, and make it as readable as possible. This will be the final version of the kata you will submit on Codewars.

### refactored.js (optional)

A refactored version of the clean code, made to be as efficient as possible. One liners are ideal, though not necessary.

## kata-test

Is a unit testing library written in and for javascript / node.js Codewars katas. For more info and documentation check the [README.md](https://github.com/Mario-paul/codewars-katas/blob/main/kata-test/README.md) file for kata-test.

## kata-template

Contains boilerplates for katas / testing environment. Copy kata-template directory into the appropriate kyu folder, rename it, and code away!
