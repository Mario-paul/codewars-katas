# Codewars Katas

This is my personal repo for past Codewars katas. It also serves as a testing environment for new katas using my own custom-made unit testing library.

## .js Files

### development.js

This file is the working / testing environment for katas. It's where you play around with code to find a solution, just like the IDE on Codewars. It's generally full of console.logs() useful for debugging.

### explain.js

This file is commented out with info for what the code does. Useful for coming back and studying solutions for future problems you might have.

### clean.js

The code in this file is the final version that will be submitted to the kata on Codewars. It is clean of console.logs() and comments, and is normally as readable as possible.

### refactored.js (optional)

A refactored version of the clean code, made to be as efficient as possible. One liners are ideal, though not necessary.

## kata-test

Is a unit testing library written in and for javascript / node.js Codewars katas. For more info and documentation check the [README.md](https://github.com/Mario-paul/codewars-katas/blob/main/kata-test/README.md) file for kata-test.
